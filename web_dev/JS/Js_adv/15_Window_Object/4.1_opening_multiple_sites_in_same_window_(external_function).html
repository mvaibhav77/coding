      // //The window name is set to "sameWindow" in both cases, which ensures that the URLs will open in the same window.

      //Please note that modern browsers are often designed to prevent websites from changing the URL of already opened windows due to security concerns. This means that while this code may work, it could be blocked by browser security mechanisms or pop-up blockers.
