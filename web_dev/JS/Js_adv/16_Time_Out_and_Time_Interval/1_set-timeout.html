      // say we want to pop up some message or something after sometime after the page is loaded  :

      // in this case we use the setTimeout(fuction name , delay duration 'ms' )

      // the setTimeout also provides an id for its event which needs to be stored in a variable in case we want to use it for further processes

      // 1000 ms = 1 second delay

      let timoutId = setTimeout(timeOut, 4000); // after 4 seconds act karware

      function timeOut() {
        alert("timeout activated ....");
      }

      // now say if we want to shut the timeout popup before it gets executed ...

      // like say 4 baje uth gaye 5 bje ka alarm tha toh bnd toh karenge na

      // For this we use the 'clearTimeout' to do so

      // for using clearTimeout we need to provide the id of the event also which is sotred in teh variable assigned to the setTimeout funtion

      // this clear timeout is used in places where we want ki say if the person hasn't subscribed thbhi ho pop up else not -> EG : 

    //   //if(condition){

    //     clearTimeout(timoutId);

    //   }
