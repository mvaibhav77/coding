    <!--  query is the most powerful selector  -->

     <!-- this is the most widely used one because here we can directly select the id class tag etc ...  -->

    <h2 class="intro">heading 1</h2>

    <div id="div1">
      <p class="intro">paragraph 1</p>

      <h2 class="intro">heading 2</h2>

      <p>paragraph 2</p>

      <h2>heading 3</h2>

      <p class="intro">paragraph 3</p>
    </div>

    <!--  now if we want ot select the p tag having that class intro we do it as :  -->

    <script>
      // to select the p tag that has intro we use this syntax in query selector

      let elm = document.querySelector("p.intro");

      // now as there are many p tags with intro means we need looping to change contents using the inner html

      for (let i = 0; i < elm.length; i++) {
        elm[i].innerHTML = "HELLO";
      }

      // this takes no effect WHY?? ??  lets see : 

      console.log(elm);

      // here we see that only one parah with class intro is selected

      elm.innerHTML="hello";

      // as only one is selected iteration nahi lagega plus why ?? only one sleected : 

      // ? this happens because when we use just the .querySelector it just stores the first one which fullfills the condition and none other 

      // if we want ot select all the parahgraphs which satisfy the condition we use .querySelectorAll 

      let ele = document.querySelectorAll("p.intro");

      // now as multiple are selected we use for loop : 

      for (let i = 0; i < ele.length; i++) {
        ele[i].innerHTML = "HELLO";
      }

      // now we see that all teh parah which have the classs intro are changed to HELLO ...
