// there are two types of functions pre defined and user defined

// pre defined functions are functions which are built in with ther language and we directly use them

//eg: alert() , prompt() ,etc...

// all the functions have () with them at the end

// user defined functions are made by the user to perform a certain task

//whenvever we have to do a task again and again we define a functioni.e. to perform a reopeated task

// define and declare  a function

function mul() {
  for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    document.write(`2 x ${i} = ${2 * i}`);

    document.write("<br>");
  }
}

// call a function 

mul();

document.write('<br>');

document.write("hello world");

document.write('<br>');
