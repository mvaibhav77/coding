    <!-- flexbox & grid is a very powerful tool ... used to create different layouts  -->

    <!-- here we will elarn about flex box 
    
     flexbox is a 1-D layout method 
    
     flex box = flexible box 
    
    a container where flex box is applied is called flex box container 
    
     the items inside it are called flex box item 
    
    the x axis is : main axis 
    
     the y axis is : cross axis 
    
     left most and right most borders are called : main start and end 
    
    top and bottom most borders are called cross start and cross end 
     -->

    <!-- by default direction of flex box elements is row wise  -->

    <style>
      .container {
        height: 1200px;

        background-color: beige;

        border: 4px solid black;

        margin: 2px;

        padding: 2px;

        display: flex;

        /* row wise  */

        flex-direction: row;

        flex-wrap: wrap;
      }

      .box {
        height: 300px;
        width: 400px;
        border: 2px solid brown;
        margin: 2px;
        padding: 2px;

        /* flex:1 just assigns all the containers equal spacing on the screen  */

        flex: 1;

        /* why we did order 1 read text below and understand  */

        order: 1;
      }

      #box1 {
        background-color: aqua;

        /* order property is used for flex items and is used to position reltively the box we want at the start middle or at the very end uing order numbers  */

        /* we should know that by default all have order : 0 so any number greater than zero will mvoe the box to the very end if any other is not assigned any order number  */

        order: 1;

        /* if order 5  */

        order: 5;

        /* if order 4*/

        order: 4;

        /* but lets say we assign a default order of order ;1 to the class of items i.e. box now the default order is 1 means any number above one will result in the container being placed at the very end  */

        order: 2;
      }

      #box2 {
        background-color: blue;
      }

      #box3 {
        background-color: orange;

        /* say we want the orange one at the very start  */

        /* as we know if we have not given any default order value means the default value is 0 so any number below zero will move the box at teh very start  */

        /* but as we mentioned an order 1 as the default order means that the number less than 1 starting from 0 to -infinity will serve as placing the container at the very start  */

        /* giving it number form -1 to -infinity places it at the start  */

        order: 0;
