    <!-- flexbox & grid is a very powerful tool ... used to create different layouts  -->

    <!-- here we will elarn about flex box 
    
     flexbox is a 1-D layout method 
    
     flex box = flexible box 
    
    a container where flex box is applied is called flex box container 
    
     the items inside it are called flex box item 
    
    the x axis is : main axis 
    
     the y axis is : cross axis 
    
     left most and right most borders are called : main start and end 
    
    top and bottom most borders are called cross start and cross end 
     -->

    <!-- by default direction of flex box elements is row wise  -->

    <style>
      .container {
        height: 1200px;

        background-color: beige;

        border: 4px solid black;

        margin: 2px;

        padding: 2px;

        display: flex;

        /* row reverse direction  */

        flex-direction: row-reverse;

        flex-wrap: wrap;


        /* DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FLEX START, FLEX END AND START , END  */

        /* NOTE: Change flex-direction to row-reverse however, and you can see the difference. When using row-reverse the main-start and main-end have been switched. The main-start is now on the right, and main-end on the left. This has not changed the text direction, however, which still runs left to right.

        Now try the various values of justify-content. You will find that flex-end moves the items to the leftâ€”the main-end of the flex container. Use end and the items move to the right, this being the flow-relative end of the container. */

        justify-content: flex-end; 


       justify-content: end;
