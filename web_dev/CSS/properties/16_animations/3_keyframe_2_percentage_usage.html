/* In the example keyframe_1 we have specified when the style will change by using the keywords "from" and "to" (which represents 0% (start) and 100% (complete)).

It is also possible to use percent. By using percent, you can add as many style changes as you like.

The following example will change the background-color of the <div> element when the animation is 25% complete, 50% complete, and again when the animation is 100% complete: */

@keyframes example {
  0%   {background-color: red;}
  25%  {width:200px ;}
  50%  {background-color: blue;}
  75%  {width:100px}
  100% {background-color: green;}
