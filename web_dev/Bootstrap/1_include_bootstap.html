    <!-- Bootstrap : Grid System + classes + components  -->

    <!-- Responsive process is primarily done using the GRID System of BOOTSTRAP  -->

    <!-- the script file of CDN of Bootstrap included here  -->

    <!-- to check the usage of include files  -->

    <!-- say we take a button code from bootstrap components and paste it here  -->

    <!-- without writing css / js out button would be styled and responsve as we included the bootstrap script and css already  -->

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>

    <!-- thus we conclude bootstrap is loaded in out file  -->
