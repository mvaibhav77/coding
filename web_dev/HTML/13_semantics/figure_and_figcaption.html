This is different than using a <p> element to describe the content; if we decide to change the location of <figure>, the paragraph tag may get displaced from the figure while a <figcaption> will move with the figure.  -->

              Dogs have a sense of time. It's been proven that they know the
              difference between a hour and five. If conditioned to, they can
              predict future events, such as regular walk times.

              A study was conducted on dogs being away from their owners for
              varying hours and the studies show that dogs who were away from
              their owners the longest showed the greatest amount of affection!
