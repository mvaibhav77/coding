      My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was

    <!-- The <aside> tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in. -->

    <!-- The aside content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content. -->

    <!-- Tip: The <aside> content is often placed as a sidebar in a document. -->

    <!-- Note: The <aside> element does not render as anything special in a browser. However, you can use CSS to style the <aside> element (see example below).  -->

    <!-- if css styling is not applied then there is no distinction between aside and normal content to make it look different we use css  -->
