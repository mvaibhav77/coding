    <!-- Two more structural elements are <main> and <footer>. These elements along with <nav> and <header> help describe where an element is located based on conventional web development standards. -->

      <!-- The element <main> is used to encapsulate the dominant content within a webpage. This tag is separate from the <footer> and the <nav> of a web page since these elements donâ€™t contain the principal content. By using <main> as opposed to a <div> element, screen readers and web browsers are better able to identify that whatever is inside of the tag is the bulk of the content  -->
