    <!-- Let’s take a look at some semantic elements that assist in the structure of a web page. A <header> is a container usually for either navigational links or introductory content containing <h1> to <h6> headings.  -->

    <!-- By using a <header> tag, our code becomes easier to read. It is much easier to identify what is inside of the <h1>‘s parent tags, as opposed to a <div> tag which would provide no details as to what was inside of the tag. -->

    <!-- A <nav> is used to define a block of navigation links such as menus and tables of contents. It is important to note that <nav> can be used inside of the <header> element but can also be used on its own. -->
